          Week 1 was spent teambuilding and finding each otherâ€™s strengths in
          preparation for the main planning phase. We also set up a vague
          outline for the process and orders necessary to complete the project.
          This can be seen below:
        </Text>
        <CustomImage src={"/images/wk1-1.png"} />
      </Stack>
    </>
